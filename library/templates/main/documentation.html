                    Auth-Wiki is a library authentication application that allows users to view different authentication
                    code sample and interact . Users can easily access/download our code samples or be able to view example usage.</p>
                <p> The users can make use of the library code when creating an authentication code or when browsing through the library</p>
                <p> At Auth-Wiki, guests are not also left out as they can easily view , interact with documentation and register to contribute</p>
                <p> Though , one of the cons of being a guest is the inability to download code while on the other hand , the registered users have full access , can interact easily , make contributions
                    , able to view example usage and download code samples. </p>

                <h4 class='mb-5'>Core User Needs</h4>
                <h5>Need 1</h5>
                <p> Web Development today and even from the onset requires some form of authentication to ensure web security
                    and user privacy on the internet. Also , the occurrence of cyber related crimes and security issues have been 
                    growing at an  alarming rate over the past few decades , Consequently , user authentication , even user authorization
                    has to be placed at the zenith of our piorities when building web applications and APIS.
                </p>
                <h5>Need 2</h5>
                <p>
                    More so , most developers are now adopting the practice of providing user authentication options , some 
                    of which affords the users to be authenticated across different platforms using just one profile or account.
                    This implies that the user registration and authentication process will become less laborious and in the long run,
                    provide unified authentication system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conclusively , to cater for the needs of developers who want to build and set up authentication systems by themselves 
                    or build on the existing ones already provided by their framework , they need a platform where they can source reusable code snippets,
                    modules or packages . Due to these reasons , we have decided to take on the challenge and create a line of actions to solve these problems
                    within the timeframe given . Auth-Wiki would be acessible on the web.
                </p>

                    <h4 class='mb-5'>Product Goals</h4>   
                    <h5>Goal 1</h5>
                    <p>
                    Since authentication has proven to be necessary in technology today, we have decided to not just build a library of authentication codes but a platform that gives users an exhaustive explanation on how to implement them. Authwiki is envisioned to be an inclusive and exhaustive library. So no programming language or framework is left out. Allowing it to serve a vast community of developers.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Goal 2</h5>
                    <p>
                        Also, knowing that not all authentication systems are on par with one another, authentication codes will have ratings which should give users an idea of how popular or functional they are. There will be a comment section under each authentication code detail so users can ask questions or give feedback on that specific code.
                        Viewing from the non-functional aspect of things, we want to provide the best possible interface to present these codes and also make interacting with the library simple and intuitive by using modern design practices and techniques to produce an appealing user interface and top notch user experience.

                    <h5>Design System Point 1</h5>
                    <p>
                        For this project we will be using the Laravel framework for backend development. The frontend development would use javascript and tentatively React for scripting, The markup would be written in HTML5 which would eventually be converted to ‘*.blade.php’ templates. Styling would be done using CSS3 and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind. Our design team would design wireframes, Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi pages for the pages below.
                    </p>

                        In summary, we would be building a monolite laravel application.The following pages will be featured on the website;

                    Auth-Wiki is a library authentication application that allows users to view different authentication
                    code sample and interact . Users can easily access/download our code samples or be able to view example usage.</p>
                <p> The users can make use of the library code when creating an authentication code or when browsing through the library</p>
                <p> At Auth-Wiki, guests are not also left out as they can easily view , interact with documentation and register to contribute</p>
                <p> Though , one of the cons of being a guest is the inability to download code while on the other hand , the registered users have full access , can interact easily , make contributions
                    , able to view example usage and download code samples. </p>    
                
                <h5 id="list-item-2">Need 1</h5>
                <p> Web Development today and even from the onset requires some form of authentication to ensure web security
                    and user privacy on the internet. Also , the occurrence of cyber related crimes and security issues have been 
                    growing at an  alarming rate over the past few decades , Consequently , user authentication , even user authorization
                    has to be placed at the zenith of our piorities when building web applications and APIS.
                </p>
                <h5>Need 2</h5>
                <p>
                    More so , most developers are now adopting the practice of providing user authentication options , some 
                    of which affords the users to be authenticated across different platforms using just one profile or account.
                    This implies that the user registration and authentication process will become less laborious and in the long run,
                    provide unified authentication system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conclusively , to cater for the needs of developers who want to build and set up authentication systems by themselves 
                    or build on the existing ones already provided by their framework , they need a platform where they can source reusable code snippets,
                    modules or packages . Due to these reasons , we have decided to take on the challenge and create a line of actions to solve these problems
                    within the timeframe given . Auth-Wiki would be acessible on the web.
